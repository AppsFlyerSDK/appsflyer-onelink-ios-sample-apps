# Getting Started with OneLink
Deep linking is the act of launching a mobile app while serving personalized content and/or sending the users to specific activities within the app. By doing so you provide users with superior user experience, greatly enhancing their engagement with the apps.

![Deep link example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61788924/85711992-864fbb80-b6f0-11ea-8549-6df8841c21b1.png "Deep-linking examples")

## Two types of deep linking
Since users may or may not have the mobile app installed, there are two types of deep linking:

| **Deep Linking**	 | Directly serves personalized content to existing users, which already have the mobile app installed |
| --- | --- |
| **Deferred Deep Linking**	 | **Serving personalized content to new or former users, directly after the installation and first application launch** |

**AppsFlyer supports both deep linking and deferred deep linking methods using its unique device detecting attribution link - OneLink.**

## Deep linking and OneLink
OneLink operates as a "bridge" between the advertisement and the mobile app. It can launch the app and provide the mobile developer with the data required to personalize the user experience. To do so develop the mobile app with deep linking capabilities and infrastructure.

## Deep linking and retargeting
Deep linking and OneLink are used to re-engage existing or past users, meaning to retarget them. This subject is covered in the retargeting guide, which should be reviewed after this deep linking guide.
